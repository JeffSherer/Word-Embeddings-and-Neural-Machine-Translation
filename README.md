# Word-Embeddings-and-Neural-Machine-Translation
Explores word embeddings and neural machine translation (NMT). The first part focuses on text preprocessing, word vectorization, and similarity analysis using WikiText data. The second implements a sequence-to-sequence NMT model with custom attention mechanisms, decoding strategies (greedy, top-k, top-p), and BLEU evaluation in PyTorch.
